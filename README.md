# Using scalapoi

This project is a work in progress, check back soon for details on how you can use this

## Aims and Features

[Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/) is a java API for Microsoft Documents... and it's bit of a nightmare to use, especially if you're using scala.

This project is designed to ease that pain a bit.

The final aims of this project are to:
- provide a purely functional, compile time safe wrapper for Apache POI
- give the ability

This project is heavily influenced by the [Typelevel](typelevel.org) [Doobie](https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie) and [Circe](https://github.com/circe/circe) projects. It uses [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless),  [cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) and [Monix](https://monix.io) to do pretty much all it's interesting stuff.
