I am still working on the foundations of this project. Check back soon.

## What's a POI?

[Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/) is a java API for Microsoft Documents... and it's a bit of a nightmare to use, even on a good day.

This project aims to ease that pain a This.

## Thanks

This little project is heavily influenced by the [Typelevel](typelevel.org) [Doobie](https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie) and [Circe](https://github.com/circe/circe) projects. It uses [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) and [cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) to do pretty much all it's interesting stuff.
